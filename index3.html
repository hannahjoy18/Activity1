        <h1>That's So True</h1>
        <h3>Song by: Gracie Abrams</h3>

        <p>
            I could go and read your mind <br> Think about your dumb face all the time <br>
            Living in your glass house, I'm outside, uh <br> Looking into big blue eyes<br>
            Did it just to hurt me and make me cry <br> Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life
        </p>

        <p>
            You're an idiot, now I'm sure <br> Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her
        </p>

        <p>
            Ooh, bet you're thinking she's so cool <br>
            Kickin' back on your couch, making eyes from across the room <br>
            Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
        </p>

        <p>
            What'd she do to get you off? (Uh-huh) <br> Taking down her hair like, "Oh my God!" <br> 
            Taking off your shirt, I did that once, or twice, uh <br> 
            No, I know, I know, fuck off (off) <br>
            But I think I like her, she's so fun <br> Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm sorry she's missing it, sad, sad boy <br> Not my business, but I had to warn ya
        </p>

        <p>
            Ooh, bet you're thinking she's so cool <br> Kickin' back on your couch, making eyes from across the room <br>
            Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
        </p>

        <p>
            Oh-ooh (ooh), you've got me thinking (got me) she's so cool (ooh) <br> But I know what I know, and you're just another dude <br>
            Ooh, that's so true, ooh
        </p>

        <p>
            Made it out alive, but I think I lost it <br> Said that I was fine, I said it from the coffin <br>
            Remember how I died when you started walkin'? <br> That's my life, that's my life
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll put up a fight, taking out my earnings <br> Don't you know the vibe? <br>
            Don't you know the feeling? <br> You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling <br>
            That's your prize, that's your prize
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, mm, bet you're thinking she's so cool <br> Kickin' back on your couch, making eyes from across the room <br>
            Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
        </p>

        <p>
            Oh-ooh (ooh), you've got me thinking (got me) she's so cool <br>
            But I know what I know, and you're just another dude <br>
            Ooh, that's so true <br> Ooh, ooh, uh
        </p>

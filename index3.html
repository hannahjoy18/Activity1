        <h1>That's So True</h1>
        <h3>Song by: Gracie Abrams</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I could go and read your mind</p>
        <p>Think about your dumb face all the time</p>
        <p>Living in your glass house, I'm outside, uh</p>
        <p>Looking into big blue eyes</p>
        <p>Did it just to hurt me and make me cry</p>
        <p>Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life</p>
        <p>You're an idiot, now I'm sure</p>
        <p>Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her</p>
        <p>Ooh, bet you're thinking she's so cool</p>
        <p>Kickin' back on your couch, making eyes from across the room</p>
        <p>Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh</p>
        <p>What'd she do to get you off? (Uh-huh)</p>
        <p>Taking down her hair like, "Oh my God!"</p>
        <p>Taking off your shirt, I did that once, or twice, uh</p>
        <p>No, I know, I know, fuck off (off)</p>
        <p>But I think I like her, she's so fun</p>
        <p>Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved</p>
        <p>I'm sorry she's missing it, sad, sad boy</p>
        <p>Not my business, but I had to warn ya</p>
        <p>Ooh, bet you're thinking she's so cool</p>
        <p>Kickin' back on your couch, making eyes from across the room</p>
        <p>Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh</p>
        <p>Oh-ooh (ooh), you've got me thinking (got me) she's so cool (ooh)</p>
        <p>But I know what I know, and you're just another dude</p>
        <p>Ooh, that's so true, ooh</p>
        <p>Made it out alive, but I think I lost it</p>
        <p>Said that I was fine, I said it from the coffin</p>
        <p>Remember how I died when you started walkin'?</p>
        <p>That's my life, that's my life</p>
        <p>I'll put up a fight, taking out my earnings</p>
        <p>Don't you know the vibe? </p>
        <p>Don't you know the feeling?</p>
        <p>You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling</p>
        <p>That's your prize, that's your prize</p>
        <p>Well, mm, bet you're thinking she's so cool</p>
        <p>Kickin' back on your couch, making eyes from across the room</p>
        <p>Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh</p>
        <p>Oh-ooh (ooh), you've got me thinking (got me) she's so cool</p>
        <p>But I know what I know, and you're just another dude</p>
        <p>Ooh, that's so true</p>
        <p>Ooh, ooh, uh</p>
